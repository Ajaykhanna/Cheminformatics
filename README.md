- [üîç Molecular Similarity Search with RDKit](https://github.com/Ajaykhanna/Cheminformatics/blob/main/rdkit/tanimoto_similarity_search.py) Unlock the Power of Cheminformatics by Exploring Tanimoto Molecular Similarity!

Molecular similarity plays a pivotal role in cheminformatics, offering insights into various applications such as virtual screening, compound selection, and drug repurposing. In this tutorial, we'll harness the capabilities of RDKit, a comprehensive cheminformatics library, to compute and analyze molecular similarity using fingerprints and the Tanimoto similarity metric.

The Tanimoto similarity (often referred to as the Jaccard index) between two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is defined as:
$$
\text{Tanimoto}(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
$$
When it comes to molecular fingerprints, this metric essentially computes the ratio of shared bits (features) to the total number of bits set in either of the two molecules.

Transforming Molecular Structures into Meaningful Numerical Descriptors!
Chemical descriptors play a crucial role in cheminformatics. By translating molecular structures into numerical values, these descriptors become the foundation for many machine learning and deep learning models. Such models aim to predict chemical properties and facilitate the drug discovery process by efficiently navigating the vast chemical space. The code below uses the RDKit library to compute a series of common chemical descriptors for a given list of molecules represented as SMILES strings.
