# Cheminformatics
A set of tutorial for applying cheminformatics techniques in Virtual Screening, Similarity Search, Conformers Generation and Presentation.
Software used are: RDkit and OpenEye
We use OpenEye main for generating eye catching figures.

# Hello! 👋 I'm Ajay Khanna

I'm a passionate computational chemist with cheminformatics expertise. I am dedicated to utilizing computational methods and tools to solve real-world problems in drug discovery and molecular modeling. I have proven track record in molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics, and structure-based transformations. Skilled in integrating machine learning techniques for rapid compound screening and predictive analytics. I have successfully contributed to developing the ligand-binding and solvation free-energy computational pipepline in a fast-paced start-up environment. Proven experience in developing Python and C++ tools for efficient big data analysis. Adept at harnessing RDKit, Open Babel, and OEChem for advanced cheminformatics applications. Seeking to bring a blend of technical proficiency and analytical expertise to future endeavors.
